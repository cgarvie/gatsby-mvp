I've been struggling with adult acne slfor 11 weeks since my son was born. I crushed up a tab and added aloe to make a face mask.

I've added other supplements to my diet as well  I haven't seen a huge difference with my milk supply but this could take some time. I work in the dental field and am exposed to heavy metals like mercury. Spirulina aids in detoxing these metals from your body.

Many women in this day and age are suffering from hormone imbalances caused by GMO foods, soy products, environmental toxins, etc. With Saw Palmetto I have seen a dramatic change that actually took me by surprise! One of the symptoms I had was Hirsutism which many women suffer from. It is caused by a build up of DHT in the body or another way of saying too much testosterone. So we would get hair growing in random places of the body where it shouldn't grow. It is quite annoying dealing with this sort of thing. Also because of this I would break out a lot when I notice my hormones are all messed up. My face would produce more oil than normal and the acne would be cystic in nature. Also it can cause your hair to thin out. I did notice a lot of my hair was falling out in the shower. I would get ovarian pain as well all caused by hormones going crazy. I could not believe all these symptoms were caused because of too much testosterone. But after having a friend tell me about saw palmetto I decided to try it out. Turns out I avoided all the pains of going to the doctor and treated it naturally.

I have lupus and can use all the help I can get to make my hair and skin look better. I am hoping this helps my hair grow back that I have lost due to the lupus. I have been taking this for 2 weeks now and like I said I can tell the difference in my skin and hair feeling softer. I have sores on my arm and face and they have been healing faster. My fingernails are starting to lose the ridges on them and look so much nicer then they use to. I have been putting this in the pink lemonade that I make for our girls to drink and they don't even know that it is in there. They are 19 and 14 and have some acne, so this has started to help their faces clear up for them. This jar of collagen is tasteless and mixes well with any drink you put it into. You can mix this in hot or cold drinks and is disappears and does not leave any gritty or slimy taste in your drinks. The jar is 7oz and you use 1 scoop a day which it will last you 30 days."}, {"rating": "1.0", "ASIN": "B0011DJ71I", "votes": 0, "id": "RTTN8LL40WVDG", "title": "It might not work for some people", "author": "Christine Dannang", "text": "I bought this product because my sisters recommended it to me, it worked for them but it did not work for me.

If it works for you, good for you, but if anything is going wrong with your body, just stop taking this. Its not worth it.

A week and a half later my acne was just as clear as it was before I started to take this! It does seem weird to me...This product did take awhile for me to get used to not having to quickly chug it because of the taste. It also does not dissolve very well; pretty clumpy in my water...What's also strange is it says \"PACKAGING may VARY\" ?!? Is this perhaps a way of saying some people will get good stuff while others don't? (There was one review on here that even says the power was not entirely full). At the end of the day: 1) I did not notice a difference in my skin other than suddenly acne on my face again 2) it's not the best of taste but not entirely awful 3) does not dissolve very well.

This is the purest form of Aloe Vera I could find. Doesn't even have preservative, so I refrigerate it. I just dab this on my face with a washcloth, which wastes a lot, but at least I'm getting nothing but aloe. I might try to make my own gel, with Xanthan gum powder, or Kaolin Clay powder. I also put this in a spray bottle and use it for hair shine / hair moisturizer. That works pretty well. Some of it runs off the hair, and if it gets in my eyes, it stings a bit, but I'm able to massage most of it into my hsir and scalp and it gives the hair a really nice non-greasy lustre. Shiny but not overly shiny, and not the slightest bit greasy. So, as for the big question....will the this  improve my facial skin....It's too soon to tell. I've used It less than a week. It does sink in nicely, instead of sitting ON the skin, it actually goes INTO the skin, and the skin feels nice afterwards (moist and soft) so I'm hopeful it might be therapeutic.

I am so not saying this is a weight loss product. I did end up researching biotin because I was curious to see if it was the biotin that was increasing my energy. I found a lot of info similar to this-  \"Biotin assists in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Biotin, as a coenzyme, is involved in energy production. It is one of the agents that converts food into energy by facilitating the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates into glucose, and breaking down of proteins into amino acids.

Today is my last day of the 10 that I am using this product and I love it!! I didn't notice any worms coming out, but I haven't been looking for them. I have become really regular with my bowel movements after starting this product. I used to poop once every day or once every other day or so, and it never really felt like I was empty. This product has me going twice a day, and the process i SO MUCH smoother and it makes me feel relieved and cleaner. I have used laxatives in the past, and this DID NOT FEEL LIKE A LAXATIVE. The bowel movements were controllable There was not cramping.  I did not experience any nausea or stomach pains at all. I don't have the bloating that I used to have before I started this, so my stomach is much flatter. Also, the company clearly cares about this products and the user experience. I have received emails through amazon from the provider, letting me know to feel free to contact them if I have any problems or concerns. I will definitely use this product every few months or so, just to maintain my intestinal health. If my acne clears up, I'll update my review to mention that. But I have had acne for YEARS and nothing really ever gets rid of it, so I am not expecting much haha. But this is a great product for the digestive purposes. I feel a lot healthier and have more energy since I've been using this product too. I used to be SO lethargic."}]}, {"SortB": 1, "ASIN": "B003XX3W0Q", "SortA": 1, "ProductName": "Nordic Naturals Pro - ProOmega, Promotes Brain and Heart Health, and Supports Healthy Eyes - Lemon Flavored 180 Soft Gels", "Reviews": [{"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003XX3W0Q", "id": "R1EFZT2IQ98H0F", "title": "wonderful product", "author": "Bastet", "text": "I'm in my 40's and I've had uneven skin tone and slight acne.

Since I was taking birth control pills, doctor didn't put me on separate prolactin medication. He wanted to wait until the levels go up high and medication becomes necessary. Last month I stopped the birth control to end dumping hormones in my body. I totally hated taking them. Both my primary physician and endocrinologist scared me that things can out of whack when i stop the pill and I that I won't get a period, lose hair, get acne and gain weight. I was terrified but made a decision that I won't take any more hormones and stopped the pill. I started EPO about 15 days before I stopped the birth control pill. I went for a test 2 weeks ago and my prolactin levels dropped to normal and the TSH levels have become very low and more normal, I only need a low dose of synthroid now and I got my period in exactly 30 days. I have been on the Birth control pill for over 12 years, so not getting a period was my worst fear. I am extremely happy and best of all no side effects. As far as new hair growth, I noticed only a 10% difference. Some new hairs not much, but no acne which is good. I take 1 pill a day usually after dinner.

After stopping the pill, I took 2 tablets three times a day (6 tabs total of Kan licorice/peony) in addition to some other herbs/supplements.

I have not experienced any cystic acne since getting off the pill! :) Yes, I still have menstrual cramps and mood swings one day a month, but I feel licorice and peony have been an immense help for my acne.

I took 1 pill w/ 8 oz of water mixed and apple cider vinegar every 12 hrs. Within 3 weeks my skin started to clear up and the tone and texture of my face looked better than ever. It was clear, smooth, and the acne was almost fully gone. The best part is the acne for the most part stays gone which has never happened before. I also started using Differen gel all over face before daily moisturizer at the same time I began taking the supplement to speed up the process. All I know is the combination of these two products did it for me and was much less expensive than a dermatologist.

I\u2019m 26 years old am I\u2019m in nursing school and I swear the only time I\u2019ve had this cystic acne is since I\u2019ve started this program. It\u2019s been on my face and on my neck and it\u2019s been incredibly painful and embarrassing.  I\u2019ve been using it for almost a month and originally started taking 2 pills twice daily. For the last week or so I cut down and I\u2019ve been taking 1 or 2 pills a day.  In the beginning I didn\u2019t notice any difference at all, but recently I\u2019ve noticed that my skin isn\u2019t as oily as it used to be. It\u2019s really nice to not have my makeup be smudging and coming off on its own by 2pm. As far as acne goes, the pimples have been slowly disappearing, and I don\u2019t have the super painful cystic acne that I had before. The blackheads have dramatically decreased as well, all in combination with the Indian healing clay masks and African black soap that I\u2019ve been using from Amazon also. My skin feels so much better! It\u2019s nice to not have the painful huge red cysts all over my chin and neck that wouldn\u2019t hide even under the best concealer.

It has been very frustrating trying to find the right creams, gels, and other acne fighting natural supplements that will actually work. The creams and gel had dried out my skin too much or they just haven't been effective or fast enough to clear my skin. I've tried ClearFace AC and All Natural Acne Solution supplements from Amazon. I tried both supplements for 2 months each and neither of them were able to sustain clear skin for me. I did get some good results for about 2 weeks but then I started to get 2-3 acne pimples on my face thereafter. Then I tried Acnetame and in 2 weeks my face was clear and it has been ever since. I may get just 1 tiny pimple here or there but Acnetame is definitely way better than any other acne fighting products I've tried! No more cystic size acne that is painful! I am so much happier that my face is clear again! It also helps control my oily skin very well. I will continue to use this supplement from here on out.

I had to go off of Spironolactone (due to a contraindication with another medication) which I had been using to control my hormonal acne for years. Sure enough, within months of going off of the Spironolactone, my hormonal acne (along the jawline, neck - painful deep cysts) came back with a vengeance. I tried topical solutions for months to no avail, so obviously I needed something that didn't only treat the surface of the skin. Amazon to the rescue! Based on customer reviews and just searching for \"hormonal acne\" I came across Acnetame. What a godsend. It didn't work right away, but it didn't take long. Because of the severity of my hormonal acne I take the maximum dosage (two tablets 2x/day), and it began drying up the hormonal acne (or getting them to where I could at least \"pop\" them, which is unheard of with cysts). Now I have virtually no hormonal acne, only a couple that pop up around that time of the month. I do get some regular zits, but they are easily treatable (or \"hideable\") and go away within a few days. So while I don't have a perfect complexion, it is a 100x better than it was a couple of months ago. I think I'm on my 4th bottle? Yes, a little pricey for sure, but definitely worth the self-confidence I've gotten back.

However, when I started a new method of birth control in January 2013 my skin started going crazy. I was getting cystic acne all over my chin and it whenever one cyst went away, another one popped up. Desperate for a solution to my awful breakouts, I tried numerous vitamins, natural products, supplements, cleansers, and every kind of skincare under the sun. Some products would work for a little while, but ultimately, my acne came back and wouldn't go away. That all changed when I began taking 2 pills of Acnetame daily. Within days of adding Acnetame to my daily regimen, I saw results. My cystic acne shrunk faster than I ever imagined it could and best of all... I had NO new breakouts!! I bought my first bottle of Acnetame in August 2013 and I have taken it every day since then because it keeps my hormonal breakouts away! I know that Acnetame is the key to keeping my skin clear because six months ago after having my tonsils removed, I couldn't swallow the pills for about a month.

I wash my face twice a day with a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash, and apply 10% benzoyl peroxide cream multiple times a day, and never even come close to drying out my skin.

Only benzoyl peroxide has an impact on prevention, and without it, my acne was out of control. I have deep acne that sometimes doesn't even surface for days, so topical treatments do almost nothing.

Before trying acnetame I had tried soo many different types of  acne products by so many brands and wasted so much money. At that time, I believed that my acne was caused by bacteria and clogged pores. I didn't have acne in high school but at the age of 25, I began to break out. Not knowing how to handle this, I  tried every type of face wash, astringent, mask and cream with strong doses of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid only to wake up to another cystic pimple. After years of failing acne products, avoiding certain foods, being sad and (I hate to say) losing confidence, I had finally gotten fed up and decided to handle this from a different angle. I started reading Internet articles on different reasons for acne and learned that even though I am 28, it was possible that my acne was hormone based instead of bacteria based. I somehow stumbled upon Murad and Acnetame.  After reading many reviews, I decided to take a risk and order acnetame. Within a couple days of using this product, I begin to notice the cystic acne on my face clear up. After two weeks of using this product, all of my acne was gone and I was so excited to not wake up to another pimple. I have been using this product for about 6 months. In the first two months, I took this product daily because I was afraid of waking up to a pimple. After two months, I began to get lazy and take this product about 2 or 3 times per week and my skin is still clear. I will be a customer forever!

I switched to an all-natural skin-care line which helped, but I couldn't help but think that it was coming from inside of me and there was no amount of topical cleansing that could change that. SO I started taking vitamins (many of the same vitamins that are in Acnetame) and that really seemed to help but I was taking like 10 different vitamins a day and it was a bit much for me. So when I saw these pills online and saw that they were basically a compilation of the vitamins I had been taking, I decided to try it. At first I didn't see any changes but now I just ordered my 3rd bottle and I can honestly say it's made a HUGE difference! I no longer have any cysts, just a couple of small pimple flare ups that are much easier to cover up. I am also getting facials twice per week and using a good toner. This combination of things has made a world of a difference and my skin is finally starting to feel balanced!

I was looking for a supplement that could cure my oily skin from the inside, out. I am a 23 year old male and have been fighting acne since I was 17. The only oral product that did the job when I was 19 was doxycycline. I took that antibiotic for 1 and a half years, but then I did not feel comfortable taking an antibiotic for any longer than that. 2 months after stopping I began to break out again. Pimples, nodules, minor cysts, papules, the whole nine yards. Then I turned to Acnefree severe that banks on 10% benzoyl peroxide to be effective. I washed my face with it for 2 years straight, twice a day. It worked and I had no side effects as my skin got used to it after all that time. However that's the bad news because I started to break out yet again after my 21 birthday once my skin got used to it. I have been on and off with BP since then but then came my discovery of Acnetame. Starting March 1 I took 4 pills a day, 2 morning-2 night and within the first week I kid you not, the amount of oil that accumulated on my face throughout the day had decreased by 50%. It has been over 2 weeks now and I'm on the second bottle. The amount of oil that accumulates on my face now is the natural amount for the right complexion to show. I have not gotten any major pimples, only a couple very small whiteheads. Bottom line, this stuff is the real deal but I will not be fully convinced until I see what happens after 1 month and into my second month. I plan to take only 2 pills a day starting my second month. KEY NOTE: Drink plenty of water while on this supplement, I noticed that I was becoming thirsty much more frequently during the last 2 weeks. I drink 100 fl oz of water everyday and this keeps me much more healthy in general everyday. Give this product a try and see how it works for you.

Also, the redness on my face sort of improved too. There was a week during which I took three pills of Acnetame a day (the week before my period came and as ladies know, our period tends to cause breakout or make breakouts more serious).

And I\u2019ve use multiple products. Just a real quick overview cystic acne is caused by hair follicles getting trapped under the skin by overproduction of oil, causing a pimple to occur under the skin. Often times cystic acne can be very painful. I\u2019ve used everything out there for cystic acne, I\u2019ve used overnight treatments and that usually just makes my acne worse. So I did more research into how I could help get rid of my cystic acne. I have very oily skin and so that was a main factor in me realizing I have an overproduction of sebum oil. To level out the sebum oil in my body I needed to take in more vitamin A. Acnetames main ingredient is vitamin A.  So I figured I would give this product a try! Overall it has made a difference in my skin texture, appearance and in the amount of oil my skin produces. I take acnetame and wash my face with Murad Acne wash.

Over the years, I've looked into different treatments to clear my skin, including topical treatments and pills (such as supplements to treat acne from the brand Murad...which did not help at all, and other antibiotics prescribed by dermatologists). I used cleansers with salicylic acid, medication with benzoyl peroxide, etc. Nothing worked! I was tempted to try Acutane as I've heard that it helps treat more severe acne, but I really wanted something more natural. I'm in my early twenties and my skin has cleared up significantly after going on birth control. That was when I learned that most of my acne was hormonal. I'm really glad I found Acnetame because the ingredients are natural and I can feel safe about taking it. I wanted to wait for results before writing a review. So far, I have finished three bottles and I'm very happy with it! It works better than the Murad ones and are more affordable as well. I think these are great supplements and ones that I can depend on (especially during that time of month for girls!) Some people seem to be bothered by the smell and size of the pills, but I think they're worth it. They contain a high percentage of B5, which is supposed to help reduce oil accumulation in the skin. It also contains selenium, which help to increase your antioxidant levels.

After struggling with hormonal/cystic acne (and having been on accutane in the past) this product seems to actually get to the root cause of the problem. Accutane was effective for me but only lasted about 2 years before I started to get acne again. After going through that I realized there must still be something wrong that is causing me to still get acne. I would highly recommend trying this product first if you are considering accutane or other damaging medications and chemicals. Since I started taking this (two pills a day for almost a month now) I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin. Definitely not completely clear yet, but hopefully getting there. I also must say that I am taking this in combination with a few other supplements. So it is hard to say how much my clearer skin is due to just this product. However I have also noticed that my nails (which have cracked and peeled my whole life!) are the strongest they have ever been! I am seriously amazed!! So that is a nice bonus :) So if you are like me and have tried everything to clear your skin here is what I would recommend after tons of research: Try eliminating gluten and processed sugar from your diet as much as possible, switch to the oil cleansing method to wash your face, and I've found success with a combination of Acnetame, probiotics (I use PRO-15), Estroblock or any form of DIM supplements, and milk thistle pills! I take a wide variety of other supplements too but this is what I believe has helped my skin the most! Everyone's body is a little different and it is all about finding what the root cause of your acne is- whether it is from food, environmental stress, etc. Personally, this product has helped me a lot along my journey to clear skin and has been very beneficial to my body instead of trying to fight off acne with damaging products."}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 0, "author": "Elsa Law", "title": "Effective!", "id": "R3733MUZM74HQU", "text": "I like the product very much, cos my acne reduce lot after I took one bottle of ACNETAME, so i reorder one more soon!

I have been taking these supplements for about a month now. I began with 1.5 pills, increased the dosage to 2 for about a week, and then reduced it back down to 1.5 pills. While I'm not completely clear, I would say they help with breakouts significantly. I experienced a bit of drying as some other reviewers have noticed as well, but I've found it to be very minimal. And either I'm so used to it now or my skin has readjusted, but I don't feel like my skin's dry anymore. I've also seen a reduction in the number of blackheads/ bumps on my forehead, which has been pervaded with these things in the past. Moreover, the chin acne has basically cleared up, if I get a pimple, it's usually just about 1 and quite rare. My cheeks were the second area that has seen improvement. This took a bit more time than the chin acne. But now, the pimples there are also rare and contained to about 1 or 2 at a time, fairly spaced out in time too. My forehead remains a bit of a problem. But I'm hoping it will eventually work its magic there too. The reason I'm rating this as 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars is because I'm not completely clear. My chin, cheeks, and the area between my eyes will get a pimple here and there. And my forehead still has a decent number of blackheads.

But other than that, this is a wonderful product and I will definitely recommend this to anyone!"}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 5, "author": "Edwin p.", "title": "the best acne cleanser", "id": "RRNNTTTNW9E01", "text": "is a very good product to cleanse the body of acne to me it is working"}, {"rating": "4.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 0, "author": "Sally", "title": "I feel like my skin gets less oily even though the weather ...", "id": "R2AVUMK5LESZ96", "text": "It really helped my acne to improve."}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 4, "author": "ktturner", "title": "Recommend", "id": "R150NA9VDDV93Q", "text": "Healed up most of the existing acne and greatly reduced breakouts."}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 3, "author": "Amazon Customer", "title": "Give it a try!", "id": "R2K4L5I6AWHOPT", "text": "This product worked for me.

But I'm also considering that any facial and hair products that I'm using are directly reacting to my skin. I was getting nuts in changing products keeping in mind of the allergens present in every thing that I pick. I've tried two dermatologists and had several derma sessions to treat my acne. I had mild to moderate acne. I started to become depressed when I realized that nothing has worked to at least lessen it. At first I was skeptical to try this but I really hoped it would work. The first week I took 2 in the morning with or without food. 2 in the evening. Glad that I had no adverse effects at all. I noticed at the first week that the redness has started to disappear. Then on the second week, began to notice that any anti-acne topical creams that I put on my face have finally taking effect. That's when I realized that this acne has to be treated first from within. I was really glad I gave it a try! BUT, the 60 caps only lasted for two weeks. :( And I didn't anticipate to run out of these caplets before my next order. In short, after I finished the bottle, it took me another two weeks to import to PH. So, my hormones have started attacking again and my acne are coming back! Now I have my second bottle and noticed that the 2caplets per day is taking effect but slow. So I have taking 4 caplets a day. The bottle would only last for 15 days if you need to take this for the first time. I really love this product seeing how effective it is. HOWEVER, the cost of this bottle plus the shipping fee + importation tax becomes this treatment really expensive. I was aghast to realize the total cost of each bottle if taking 4 caplets a day would continue for at least 3months. I've ordered my 3rd bottle before I run out of the 2nd , noting of the effect and hopefully on the 4th bottle (2nd month) would help me cut down the cost by reducing to 2 caplets a day, and then 1x a day as maintenance, as prescribed in the label. If you have tried everything BUT nothing seems to work, this could be your last hope. It is worth the try, as I must say, though it is really pricey if taking 2bottles per month is the only way for it to work.

I am almost done with the 2nd bottle and have taken this product faithfully as directed on the bottle.  Around the 2nd to 3rd week is when I noticed my skin was starting to look better.  I only broke out a little which is really good considering I would break out all the time.  So far Acnetame has been working well in correcting my acne problem so I will continue to take it.  I have been taking 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill at night which is pretty good considering some other acne pills require you to take 6-10 daily.  The pills have a bit of a strong smell but it's not so bad when you take them.  I would recommend this to anyone that has acne problems.  It may take a few weeks to see results but it's well worth the time and money when you see the results.

However I'm roughly two weeks into taking 4 of these a day ( two in the morning with food, 2 when I eat dinner later) and I can honestly say I am seeing a very noticeable difference in my skin. I suffer from a combo of cystic and subclinical acne. Basically the little white bumps that never come to a head and if you force them to will break open the surface of your skin and take forever to heal and look hellish whilst healing...not fun. My skin also became much smoother overall and under and on my chin where I seem to breakout the most has all but vanished now, and my other spot being my forehead is virtually clear as well. In the end my acne problem stems from what I've gathered from my diet so taking these along with some lifestyle changes like cutting out a bunch of excess sugar I eat and lowering my caffeine intake along with combining all this with a vitamin A supplement has done a lot of good for me. I also exfoliate my skin about once a day with a normal target branded salacilic acid acne scrub pretty standard stuff. Out of all the stuff I've tried these have worked the best for me and I'll continue to go through the rest of the bottle (about a week left) and see how it goes. If it continues to go well I'll most likely purchase another as I view spending thirty bucks a month for clear skin totally worth it.

Accutane and vitamin A are not exactly the same, but they are very close. I read the comments of people taking 4 pills of this daily for years. You are basically taking Accutane 10mg for extended amounts of time, which can cause birth defects, liver damage, and other non noticable side effects. Taking high doses of this supplement in the beginning is ok but once your skin is clear you should try to lower the dose for your safety. If you are considering having kids and take this supplement in high doses stop before you conceive. Know what you are putting into your body (or your kids)! Stay safe everyone.

I've been genetically pre-dispositioned for break outs all my life, my  mother is over 60 and she still gets them. I'd tried multiple methods over the years, face masks, vitamins, cleansers, lasers, scrubs, etc. I'd finally seen a dermatologist and they wanted to put me on Accutane. I'd heard about it and was worried, what with all the bad side effects and possible destruction of my liver. I'd begun the process, had my blood work done, and everything, when due to a clerical error at the doctor's office, it was going to be another week before I would be accepted to pick up my prescription. I'd been having second thoughts about the medication at the beginning, but with the delay, it seemed as though it was a sign to try and find another solution. I searched online and found Acnetame. I was skeptical at first, but even after the 1st day, I began to feel the effects. I drank 4 bottles of water after that 1st pill, feeling completely dried out. Within days, the acne I already had began to dissipate, and no new ones began to form (something that's never happened to me before.) After a full month of daily doses, I have all but no facial growths, and the bacne on my chest and back have diminished 10 fold. While I am aware the scarring may take months, if ever, to heal, with a little concealer, for the first time in my adult life I feel like people are seeing ME, and not the acne. I actually am auditioning for a stage play for the first time in years, because I don't feel ashamed of my face. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone I could. I followed the directions of the bottle, I stopped eating dairy, all but ended sugars, greasy foods, and red meats, and focused on healthy eating.

Nothing has really treated it nor helped until Acnetame. I'm on my 2nd bottle and I've noticed a HUGE difference in decreased breakouts.  My acne is purely hormonal driven and very stubborn to treat, primarily because it stems from decreasing/increasing estrogen/testosterone fluctuations. So though I refer to it as acne it's really worse than acne, it's painful deep tissue, ingrown hairs, festering sores, at time my face actually hurts. Since I started Acnetame my face has improved dramatically, I'm less self conscious and wearing less make up. I am taking the double dose as suggested.  An added benefit, that only makes this product now a staple to my daily topical regiment, is how it has helped my nails. I have thyroid issues as well and my nails are prone to splitting, cracks and ridges...all of that has improved dramatically as well.

The condition is complicated by the fact that I suffer from fibroids and have to avoid certain hormones and ingredients that can aggravate that condition, which make the acne worse. Off and on, doctors have given me different combinations of antibiotics and birth control.Many have been effective, but some had side effects so severe I chose to just deal with the acne. I found that some essential oils and clay masks were helpful in calming breakouts after they'd happen and with reducing the dark marks. Given this information, I decided to look for natural ways to stop or slow the breakouts when I read about Acnetame. The mix of vitamins, minerals and NAC appealed to me because these were things I had heard of or used in different proportions or products. The cost is reasonable,so I thought it was an easy investment. At minimum I would be getting more vitamins and minerals. When I received my bottle on 8/24/17, I took my first pill that evening and began taking it three times a day with food thereafter. At the time, I had a breakout of whiteheads and cysts on my forehead and cheeks. By 8/29/17 my forehead had cleared and my cheeks had calmed down a little. That breakout had cleared completely by Labor Day. Now at the begining of week four of using the product, I have some whiteheads but they are much smaller than before. The inflammation in some older, healed spots has gone down significantly. The overall surface of my skin is smoother as well.Other than an iron supplement, I am not taking anything else, so I know this is the Acnetame helping. I am excited to see what happens as the weeks progress and I hope this helps someone else."}, {"rating": "4.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 0, "author": "V.

Ferrous sulfate-causes a vitamin E deficiency-it is used in labs to induce vitamin E deficiencies in lab animals. This product is essential for hormone related acne sufferers. I also use products containing sulfur. I have read recently that, the number 2 cause of death is doing what your doctor tells you. I know my acne was caused by doctors-who only get rich off of treating diseases they can't cure. They know they induce disease to get rich-I hate doctors and stay away from them-a bunch of greedy sociopaths-I worked in long term care-I have seen what they do to people-life worse than death-they turn people into vegetables-and make money doing it. I use Christian science. My grandmother was a nurse and she told me-\"if you want to be healthy stay away from doctors\" they also put ferrous sulfate in all prenatal supplements for expectant mothers-which does a lot of damage to the baby and mother-hormones are destroyed when ferrous sulfate destroys all the Vitamin E in your body - causing difficult childbirth and gender problems in the fetus-anything to make money for these truly evil doctors.

Let me say first that the seller did have it shipped fast and it arrived in the mail quickly. When I opened the package it had a piece of paper attached with a rubber band to the bottle. It was asking to leave a 4/5-star review to receive a free bottle, and if you leave a video review you would receive two free bottles. I thought this was a little strange but trashed it and excitedly started the regimen. I am a 26 year old female with oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. I have breakouts frequently. Usually, they are about 5 pimples on my face at a time and occasionally an itty bitty zit or two. At a week and half in I broke out something fierce. This breakout was like nothing I have EVER had. My face was COVERED in tiny, tiny zits clustered closely together. It took a week for it to clear up, and it almost seemed like an allergy type break out. I thought to myself, \"Ok maybe it was just a \"cleanse\" as some products say they will do that at first.\" Well another week went by and I had another ridiculous break out, PLUS this time I developed Enlarged Circumvallate Papillae. Side effects of ECP caused a constant tickle in my throat which led to me constantly coughing my head off. I can't say that Acnetame is exactly what caused this, BUT it was the only thing different in my routine - plus I have never had the issue before sooo? I decided to stop taking them immediately, and the breakout and ECP gradually got better over the next 2 weeks. I decided to get back on here and read more reviews, since the first time I just skimmed and saw that it had tons of 5 star reviews.

Acnetame contains 3 vitamins that help insulin resistance\u2014NAC, Chromium, CoQ10. After 1-mo of use it has evened out my skin tone, lightened-up my hyperpigmentation, flattened my old raised scars, and has held back new cystic acne that was habitually persistent on my chin & around my mouth.

None of those things had happened to me and the only thing that was different was me taking these pills. Then I continued to read and saw that when people take blood thinners they are more susceptible to getting broken blood vessels in their eyes. Not sure if this thinned my blood but it was terrible! It was very awful looking in that my entire eye turned blood red and took a full 37 days to heal! Now I\u2019m not entirely sure if these pills did anything to make this happen, but I had never gotten one before, never did anything physically to cause one, and mine was rather severe (most heal in a week).

I've been struggling with hormonal acne ever since my second year of college, most likely due to stress. My dermatologist at the time prescribed me antibiotics and Differin, which made my acne significantly worse. I don't really believe in \"skin purging\" and the mantra \"it gets worse before it can get better\"- I believe that a treatment should work for the entire duration that a person is taking it, right from the beginning. With a little a more research, I concluded that my skin was sensitive and that I needed to go on a more natural route. I stopped using all of my prescribed medication and started using natural skincare products. In addition to a healthy diet and exercise, I saw massive improvement in my skin, but I was still experiencing a bit of cystic acne, especially during my time of the month. My mom found out about Addrena Acnetame and told me about all the beneficial, skin-clearing vitamins it had. After reading other people's reviews and success stories, I decided to try it out for myself. My first month taking Acnetame was a success- my hormonal acne was non-existent and my skin looked overall healthier. I was so surprised and ecstatic on how well this supplement worked! But it makes sense- all the vitamins in Acnetame are necessary for maintaining hormonal balance. I've been using Acnetame for almost two years now, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best, natural acne solutions on the market today.

I maybe would have no more than 5 blemishes on my face at any given time, caused directly by the increased amount of sebum that was being produced. I just reached a certain point in my life at 20 years old, where doing all the right things- washing my face twice a day, eating healthy, and exercising regularly, just wasn't enough to fully end my struggle with acne. I wanted a fully clear face... always. I knew that I needed that extra nutritional defense mechanism, to fight my acne from within, instead of trying to battle the acne that I currently had through my regular routine. Acnetame was exactly that - it reduced the oiliness of my skin, to where I can actually go a full day without having to dab with a paper towel or cloth for the first time in my life. My face cleared up entirely and my skin is now so soft. I maybe experience one or two pimples a week due to exam stress but I just stick to my regular routine, letting acnetame do its trick. I don't pick or pop anymore, and the blemish is usually reduced significantly in size and redness within a few hours or overnight.

First with topical washes, the three step treatments, charcoal clenansers, black soap, tea tree oil, .  You name it, we tried it.

He then wanted to do Acutane which requires blood tests and close monitoring. I wasn't on board with that until I tried all measures. I'm a firm believer in natural treatments, so I looked into that further, angry that I didn't think of it sooner.  Of course, it has to work on the inside before seeing results on the outside. So after reading the reviews, I ordered Acnetame.  Most said to take two tablets to see results, so we did two tablets twice daily for the first few days to have it build up. Then went to one tablet twice a day.  It seemed like his skin was getting less inflamed after about two weeks.  The size of his breakouts were decreased.  I wasn't sure it was working until he went camping for a week and didn't take the Acnetame. He returned with pizza face and his first words to me on his return were \"I need my acne vitamins.\"  I gave him two twice a day and by the third day his face and back were clearly less red and less inflamed. The packaging and the reviews stated that more than one bottle may be required, so I'm anxious to continue the treatment.  So far I think it's working, but will need to evaluate after another few weeks of taking.  I am happy that it's natural vitamins rather than the harsh prescriptions the doctors are pushing, some which made his face hurt and peel.

The next step would've been Accutane, but she is a college volleyball player and didn't like the sounds of the side effects.  So, after extensively searching for optional products online, we came across Acnetame and gave it a try. She is mega-dosing with it (3 pills in the am, 2 in the afternoon, and 3 again in the pm), and it has worked perfectly for her!! No side effects, but best of all she is loving her skin!! We figure it's cheaper than Accutane with the Dr. and lab visits involved, and there are no side effects--just clear skin!"}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 0, "author": "Ekaterina", "title": "GREAT PRODUCT!!", "id": "R15842CAKAP905", "text": "Before I purchased this, I struggled with hormonal acne for over 2 years.

I would say that I have some scar tissues, and a couple new ones popping up on a weekly basis, but my case isn't severe, I'd say that it's about moderate. I used 2 bottles of this product last year and I wasn't patient enough for it to work, so I stopped using it. But after not seeing much result on any prescription medications, I decided to give it another try, and I'm glad that I did. This time, I started on 4 tablets per day, 2 in the morning and 2 at night. Along with using this product, I also use thayers aloe vera toner, pure rose hip oil, ice the problem areas twice per day for about 1-2 minutes, benzolproxide wash in the morning, prescription 0.3% differin at bedtime, dead sea mud mask 1-2 times per week, black carbon mask once per week, dove beauty bar twice a day to cleanse, and vitamin and antioxidant rich moisturizers on a daily basis. My skin type is combination, and resilient, so it takes a lot for anything to penetrate through and to work. I also use non clog and oil free makeups. In the, meantime, I get weekly acupuncture to balance my hormones. Acnetame has increased the effectiveness of the entire regimen more than just using the creams and masks alone, acnetame works internally, while the other products work externally. I have decreased the dose to 2 tablets per day once the results stabalized after bottle 3. I think the reoccurance of acnes have decreased by about 30% with the help of acnetame, but individual results will vary on different people. I would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with acne but please be patient and start high on the dose to see better results."}, {"rating": "5.0", "ASIN": "B003VD9EIC", "votes": 0, "author": "Carolyn M.", "title": "Acnetame has really helped me with my skin!

They worked a little while, but my acne came back soon. Before I used acnetame, I usually got new cystic acnes every two-week. I am afraid to sleep late and drink anything with caffeine like coffee and coke. For me, the late sleeping will bring about very severe cystic acnes.  Everything changed after I used acnetame on May, 2015. Although it is just one-month usage, I have virtually no hormonal acne, only one or two pop up within this month. I have to say I always worked overtime for this irregular month and drink a lot of coffee, probably it affects my therapy a lot. Even I don\u2019t have a perfect course of treatment, it is one-hundred percent better than it was a couple of months ago. I know that acnetame is the key to keeping my skin clear up.

I started taking this two days ago, and notice a drastic difference every morning. Today is my third day and all of them are gone except two- which are almost gone. I can't believe this and I am so happy!!!! They are pretty easy to swallow, and I take two in the morning and two in the evening. It's so much better than having to gulp down 8-10 pills a day like I had to with pantothenic acid & 6-8 pills a day will Clearzine. I've been struggling with acne since 6th grade, and at the current age of 21 my acne has only gotten worse over time. It went from tiny spots here and there that never left marks, to a lot at once all the time, to cysts and puss, and then as I matured I started getting different types of acne depending on my diet. But I have never been acne-free for more than a week. My skin was ok and manageable for a few months, but then strangely I started to get those huge bumps all over my face that hurt and you can't even squeeze them.

And as I've gotten older my acne has gotten worse especially depending on environment, stress, hormones, diet etc. I tried everything from home remedies to tv infomercials. Nothing worked, all I had to show for my experiments was red dry skin with worsened acne. So by recommendation I tried Neutrogena Naturals face wash. Which actually helped tame my breakouts. didn't make it go away but certainly left my face feeling smoother with fewer big outbreaks. So upon deciding that trying a more natural remedy might be a good idea I did some research. You have to take care of yourself from the inside out. meaning that just putting something on your pimples on the outside isn't going to completely take care of your problem.

Okay not horrible it was mild but it was a build up because I dealt with severe acne growing up and the only thing that made it mild was dieting , cutting out dairy and sweets and cows milk I switched to almond milk and I went to an allergist to find out I was also allergic to eggs and peanuts which gave me forehead and chin acne. I sacrafice and cut these all out and started to lose a lot of weight because I was paranoid if every food because I still Mildly broke out. I took vitamin A before when I was about 18 and broke out so badly that I just toss the whole bottle but it was the beta caretone version. This year my sister said she was gonna try NOW brand vitamin A and I warned her that it broke me out badly in the past and not to. But she listened to the good reviews on here and purchased. I notice that her skin was clearing after a week and so smooth and then after three weeks no new acne. I had nothing to lose I was so depress because I my mild acne was becoming bad again and I was tired of losing weight and watching my diet so much. I tried her bottle before I bought my own and listen to me, my skin PURGED! This is retinoids version so idk if there is a difference with beta caretone but this version also broke me out in the first 4 days. I'm at th point of my life where there is nothing to lose so when I purged I didn't even react much like I use to. It's either you wanna purge to clear skin or you want to not purge and not ever experience the great affects of Vitamin A. The purge was like a week and then my skin started clearing and better yet HEALING! My red marks started getting a faded gray which is better because it was easier to lighten with grade cream! I'm a Caremel African American and I started to scar so easily until this vitamin. You want to know the best part of the vitamin? I can eat what I want now ! I still avoid peanuts and eggs but sweets I can finally eat again because vitamin A helps so much that I stopped breaking out. If I do it's sooooo small and last like a day or two, really small small small bump. So small and that's rarely. I have my life back and even though I'm healthier now with my diet since I'm use to it now I can still cheat and eat what I want and not suffer consequences. If you take this vitamin please take vitamin d3 with it which also helps with skin. Also make sure you take one a day not two, and also buy NOW version (Retinol) thank you so much vitamin A, my bacne is gone, my acne is pretty much non existence and I'm not scared of food anymore. It really saved my life and saved my summer. Also thank my sister for not listening to me. Acne will slowly cure or greatly vanish from the ROOT problem.

He was failing in school and having a hard time focusing. The worst side effect for him is the depression.

I had no idea that a vitamin could have this effect! Needless to say,  he is no longer taking this supplement. It has been 4 days now since we realized and took him off.

And I use Lavo moisturizer which is a moisturizer designed for complicated skin. Every so often I use clay masks to refresh my skin by tightening it and pulling out the gunk. I also have purchased on Groupon laser treatments for acne which really helps kill the bacteria deep in your skin. I have only done one of those treatments thus far but the combination of everything and taking vitamins has helped. I have also cut back my dairy intake which I think has helped. This is a completely honest personal review that I wanted to write to help encourage others. Be patient. Don't give up so soon and stick to a routine to see results.

Nothing seemed to work (ProActiv, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Retin A topical ointment, etc).  My acne got so out of control that I was prescribed Accutane for a few years on and off.  As soon as I stopped taking it, my acne would come back with a vengeance.  Once completely off of the Accutane and feeling hopeless with my returning acne, I decided to do some research.  When I found out that Accutane is really a much stronger form of vitamin A (but with harsh chemicals), I focused on learning more about vitamin A, and came across this higher dosage on Amazon.  Decided to try it, and wish I would have found out about this sooner.  I still do have oily skin, but my acne is nearly gone!!  It's been a little over 2 months of taking this vitamin everyday, and absolutely NO new break outs.  My skin actually has a glow to it.  I'm also taking Vitamin C,  Zinc, and Biotin, which are supposed to be really good for your skin, so maybe those three other vitamins are helping as well.  I am aware of the risk that has been mentioned regarding the higher dosage (potentially being harsh on the liver).  However, I don't drink, smoke or have any health issues whatsoever.  My doctor also confirmed that this was a much better alternative than the Isotretinoin (Accutane).  I'm giving this 4 stars because it contains gelatin (like many gel caps).  I'm a vegetarian, and gelatin is NOT a vegetarian ingredient.  Unfortunately, I was not able to find any other brand that makes this dosage and vitamin without gelatin.  Also, I've noticed my hair started thinning while taking this vitamin.

But has some side effects.", "author": "Johnathan B.", "text": "First off it came in a timely matter and was exactly as pictured here on Amazon so that's great also the quantity for the price is good too. Now if you are like me and you bought this in hopes of helping your acne then I say look no further and read on. So I am now ending week one of taking two of these per day, one at night and one in the morning and I can say that it is already doing wonders for my skin. I am not totally acne clear but what has surprised me the most is how I have little whiteheads in my chin and on my forehead...subclinkcal acne, and these little bastards are painful and no matter how much I exfoliated my skin and squeezed the crud out of them they alway came back within a couple days...it was very frustrating, in the end I tried virtually every topical thing I could find with some decent results from a few things but never to the extent I've seen after just one week of taking this. Sounds too good to be true? Well in part it is as this does come with some side effects, most weirdly for me was I got the runs the first few days I was on it, after that it cleared up but things in that area are still a bit runny... Eh small price to pay if you ask me, I also seem to be a lot more thirsty in general, and my skin is certainly drier than it has been previously but in my case that's beneficial. So how does this work? Well basically what your doing when you take this is a controlled overdose of vitamin A, I also recommend taking zinc and magnesium while doing this to help speed up your body's healing process in general. Anyhow vitamin A in a nutshell works wonders for acne sufferers because it promotes the creation of new skin cells, and reduces the amount of sebum AKA oil your skin produces, so if your pores get clogged from oily skin like me then this is a great option to try. On top of that it also does wonders to reduce inclination in your skin as well, basically flattening existing whiteheads and taking away much of the redness of irritation from acne breakouts, my breakouts now look more like a scrape on your elbow that scabbed over then acutual red marks now. How long does it take? Well everyone's body reacts differently to different things so it's hard to say, but you should notice some difference within about 1 week of consistently taking this, I noticed my skin being much less oily in as little as three days and now entering the end of week one, begging of week two I am seeing a real benefit to my skin, it's tone and I am noticing much, much less new white hands or blemishes, and I can only imagine as I keep going things will continue to improve more and more.  In short does it work? Yes but beware of potential side effects as this is 500% of your daily value, not a typeo this is 5x as much as your body actually needs, like I said earlier this is a controlled overdose of vitamin A, one step down from prescription stuff so use this cautiously and watch for signs of acute vitamin A poisoning."}, {"rating": "2.0", "ASIN": "B00LEVVKW6", "votes": 0, "id": "R3LG4PDIP26PUQ", "title": "Hair loss at ~15,000 ius after only 3 days.

I had spent countless hours researching supplements and foods to help support female health, primarily relating to regaining/maintaining hormonal balance and breast health. The more I read about evening primrose oil, it began to sound like the \"female miracle pill\" to solve pretty much any issue going on. You can read all about it in length on various websites and how it is used for hormonal balance, PMS-related symptoms, migraines, menopause, etc. It also is listed to help with many skin conditions such as eczema, acne, and rosacea. I didn't suffer from any of those (except of course, I am not perfect and have had minor acne occasionally) but I will state that after a week or so of regularly taking this product I could visibly see a positive change in my face/skin. It just sort of radiated and looked more youthful and glowing and just overall nicer. And though I never had much of an acne problem, since taking this pills (for almost a year now), I have absolutely clear skin 99% of that time. And oooh boy those few times I got a few blemishes I was upset!

I felt better than I have in a long time, noticeable increase in energy level to the point that I realized quickly I can't take this past afternoon and still sleep well. However, after a couple of days at full dosage, the acne hit. I do have breakouts from time to time, but this was different and initially I couldn't figure out what was going on. I Googled spirulina side effects, and sure enough there were many people who said they had the same reaction. Spirulina, like many other sea products, is very high in iodine, and what your body doesn't need it excretes, through both urine and sweat. Unfortunately, it seems many people are sensitive to it and it causes inflammation in the pores, causing acne. So I quit taking it and within a day the breakout had cleared. I'm disappointed because it made me feel great, so I'm experimenting with taking a lower dosage. The quality of this product is great, but I gave only 4 stars because of the reaction. Oh, and other reviewers commented on the taste. Seaweed isn't going to taste like candy, but I've got a pretty sensitive palate and these aren't bad. A big gulp of water and they're down, no aftertaste or burping like fish oil. I think those people are used to Flintstones or something. All in all, I think this is a good herbal supplement, I felt better when taking it. If you are in the market for this type of product, then do not hesitate to buy from this seller.

From sibo, sivo, parasites and my biggest usage from my natural doctor is candida. I will say it is quite potent and to be careful on it. I would suggest talking to your doctor about thorne molybendum glycinate and you will read why it helps die off tremendously. My liver has a harder time ridding todins so I have to have liver support supp. I also can not express enough to be regular. When bad things start dying inside you yhey need to be ridded properly. This pair well with a good anti-fungal diet. I took with and wo moly tho and moly helped with die off. I also learned to much anti-fungals at a time can be harmful. If too much is dying and not being eliminated fast enough you can get very sick so lot's of clean water and good nutrition is needed. I suggest before taking it if not working with a doctor to study on food to promote healing during die off to keep your body regular and promote optimal liver, kidney and GI function so you are properly eliminating and your immune system is strong. If you feel things are dying faster than your body can rid you may want to slow down or take a break. I have been battling severe GI proboems and a fibro dx for over 2 years. Working with my natural doctor on diet and a combo of quality supplements like Melia Supreme has made my symptoms in a month down by half already. I did have to take a little break to let my body catch up as I am extremely burdened with bad things in my body but am resuming again. You may get acne breakouts. I found a organic body wash with cocunut oil in it with natural anti-inflammatory, natural anti-fungal and anti-bacterial prlpertiess help the inflammation and cysts calms down. This can happen often during die off if more is dying than is being eliminated and will then try and come out your skin. So I can say it absoulutely kills the yuck in your body and if taken with caution and properly can improve your health. Just to not overdue it.

I had taken plenty of supplements with Biotin in it and I never noticed anything different so I stopped those, but I also didn't have any reactions to them either. I took these as instructed for about a month and a half before I stopped because I didn't notice anything changing. I barely had any growth other than my usual slow rate with my roots (I color my hair, but nothing too harsh like bleaching). I guess I can say I had a little less fall-out but it was hard to measure. What I noticed that I started breaking out more often, particularly around my chin and mouth area which is the usual hormonal area. I'm an esthetician so I am usually able to get rid of small breakouts very fast. What started happening was that I was getting acne there consistently and not just usually around the same time I get it when I have my cycle. I never really had a major issue with acne besides white heads. That was enough to get me to stop completely. Something about this must have unleashed something fierce with my hormones because now I have been having the WORST acne of my life (bigger, deeper pimples) and it just won't stop. I think I start getting it under control and then more start to pop up in its place. Afterwards, I am left with a growing number of post-acne marks. Nearly a month after stopping, I am having worse acne than I did even as a teenager, and to make matters worse, the skin around the lower half of my face is bone dry. I can put serums with hyaluronic acid, moisturizers, and hydration sprays and my skin just keeps turning dry and tight. I am a skincare expert, and my face is my business. I am embarrassed because of how my skin looks because I have NEVER had anything mess with my hormones as badly as this did. Like I've said, I have NEVER had a reaction to other items with biotin in it until I used this.

Maybe the new bottle is fresher? I don't know, but the ingredients are still the same, which is good.

I tried another very popular vitamin a couple years ago, which worked REALLY well, however, it caused me to have severe cystic acne, & I had had clear skin for pretty much all of my life (I know it was something in the formulation, because my mom also broke out from them). So, I had to stop them. Subsequent to that, I had just been dealing with hair breakage, no matter what I used on my hair or did to modify my diet. After doing a lot of research here on Amazon, and being skeptical of many of the different types of vitamins, because one, I did not want severe acne again, and two, a lot of these reviews are from people who receive free or extremely discounted products, l finally decided on this one because of its ingredients (and no soy). I can say after taking these vitamins for one month, I have noticed a difference in my hair. It is not a miracle, hence the four star rating, and my hair grows pretty slow. However, I did notice within the first two to three weeks of taking the vitamins that my hair texture was a lot softer (I think someone else mentioned that too in another review), and my nails appeared to get stronger by about 20%. Also my hair has not really grown faster, but it stopped shedding, so that is a major benefit. Plus, I have not experienced the side effects of any skin breakouts yet. I plan to take these vitamins for another two months, since they say that generally speaking, you must wait for 90 days to see real results for any hair vitamins. Fingers crossed. So far so good though....definitely worth a try.

The main two reasons that I wanted to try out Neem supplements, is the fact that it can help to clear up your skin for one. I have horrible acne and as my hormones have changed now that I'm in my 30s, it has gotten worse. Secondly, neem is supposed to help with stomach ulcers, which I have had trouble with since my early twenties. I usually take 2 capsules, one in the morning and one in the evening, after eating. The bottle recommends taking them with warm water, but I  choose not to because I just can't stomach warm water. I take them with cold water and so far, it seems to be working just fine for me. Since I started taking neem, I have noticed a gradual clearing of my skin. I have also noticed less stomach issues with my ulcers, but my skin is far more noticeable. I believe the ulcers will take more time. Many  people take neem as a detox supplement. It is supposed to rid the body of harmful substances so I suppose that's a plus too!

Therefore signs of severe lack of this mineral will result in recurrent and resistant infections such as UTIs, candida, other fungal infections, parasitic, and bacterial infections, all sorts of cancers, cysts, benign or malignant resulting from chronic cellular injury and inflammation from these systemic infections.  Iodine/iodide , in the right amounts and treatment time, will heal all eczemas, acne, skin tags, moles, and other long standing skin problems you may have that are of unknown cause.  Look into therapeutic dosages (in mg not drops) used by Dr. Lugol, Dr. Brownstein, and Dr. Truss, for guidance (their therapeutic doses ranged anywhere from 150mg - 1g+ per day).  The Lugol's solution should be at least 7%, 10 or 12% is best.  Lugol's solution, as a part of a dramatic large scale lifestyle change, has healed me from a recurrent UTI problem I had my whole life, and has also healed my Interstitial Cystitis.  I hope you are able to be open-minded enough to educate yourself on the dangers and ignorance of modern health care providers, and the drive behind promoting synthetic and inefficient Rx drugs, that only treat the symptoms of a deficiency based problem."}]}, {"SortB": 2, "ASIN": "B014MHI0DA", "SortA": 2, "ProductName": "NOW Calcium D-Glucarate 500 mg,90 Veg Capsules", "Reviews": [{"rating": "3.0", "ASIN": "B014MHI0DA", "votes": 3, "id": "R3GCC6IY1PWZVR", "title": "Delayed ovulation", "author": "Gradgirl", "text": "I took this to help with my sudden onset adult acne.

It's awesome that these are a 1000 MG because I wouldn't want to swallow 6 pills a day or more to get the same amount. I read spirulina is great for acne. I've been struggling with adult acne slfor 11 weeks since my son was born. I crushed up a tab and added aloe to make a face mask. I've been taking spirulina for almost 2 weeks snow and I've seen a huge difference in my skin being clearer. Like I said before, I added spirulina to my diet to help balance my hormones. I have pcos and am having difficulty producing enough milk for my son. I've added other supplements to my diet as well  I haven't seen a huge difference with my milk supply but this could take some time. I work in the dental field and am exposed to heavy metals like mercury. Spirulina aids in detoxing these metals from your body.

Recently I've come to the conclusion that I have to balance 4 things for good skin: healthy diet, topical skin care routine that works with my skin type, exercise regularly (and avoid stressful situations) AND finally (the key to the other three factors working is this fourth component): I need to increase my supplement intake to clear my skin.

In addition to this (it is a big pill - beware) I take vit c, elderberry, and more zinc. It's been 3 weeks now and my skin is getting better and better each day.

It's awesome that these are a 1000 MG because I wouldn't want to swallow 6 pills a day or more to get the same amount. I read spirulina is great for acne. I've been struggling with adult acne slfor 11 weeks since my son was born. I crushed up a tab and added aloe to make a face mask. I've been taking spirulina for almost 2 weeks snow and I've seen a huge difference in my skin being clearer. Like I said before, I added spirulina to my diet to help balance my hormones. I have pcos and am having difficulty producing enough milk for my son. I've added other supplements to my diet as well  I haven't seen a huge difference with my milk supply but this could take some time. I work in the dental field and am exposed to heavy metals like mercury. Spirulina aids in detoxing these metals from your body.

I am thinking the fish oil suppliers are secretly putting more than 50% soy into each of their capsules. So if you do the math on how much fish oil you are actually buying with cheaper brands, you are probably paying about the same price. Oh and in a mans body I found soy can act like estrogen, which can cause acne other mild side effects such as constipation, bloating, and nausea.

I started taking these the Saturday I received them. I can say in the days I have been taking them I have noticed significant new growth. My hair grows SLOWLY so new growth within a day or 2 is EXCITING!! I tried taking these before and had horrible break outs so I stopped. I noticed nothing at that time except the acne (not a lick of new growth). That was a deal breaker. When I stopped I began taking a prenatal vitamin and lots of biotin. I notice healthier hair and some faster growth with those vitamins (not the Hairfinity) but I don' t think it compares to what I am seeing with less than a week of taking Hairfinity this time. I read somewhere biotin causes acne so drink lots of water. Strangely, when I took high doses of Rexall brand bitoin no breakouts. Well after talking to family I thought I'd try Hairfinity again. This time I intentionally try to drink LOTS of water. I also use Clearasil and a oil free moisturizer. Can't say I have any breakouts due to this product so far but I am eating more and have gained a little weight. :( I thought to take at night like I did my other vitamins to offset the copious amount of eating but I don't' want to disrupt what seems to be in the working and thanks my HAIR GROWING. I also changed my shampoo regimen. I use Carol's Daughter anti frizz and anti breakage instead of Joico Body Luxe (which I was really liking). So between the Hairfinity and new hair care products I think I'm gonna be alright. I hope to keep to have a better review later on but for now... I'm liking it. :)"}]}, {"SortB": 0, "ASIN": "B01LQPZ8BS", "SortA": 1, "ProductName": "Extra Strength Saw Palmetto Supplement & Prostate Health - Prostate Support Formula to Reduce Frequent Urination and DHT Blocker to Prevent Hair Loss - Non GMO, GLUTEN FREE Prostate Supplement", "Reviews": [{"rating": "1.0", "ASIN": "B01LQPZ8BS", "votes": 2, "author": "Amazon Customer", "title": "Complete waste of my money", "id": "RV68P3JCO4RWY", "text": "I had heard impressive things about using Saw Palmetto for cystic hormonal acne.

My periods are regular on this supplement and when they stop at the end of my three days it stops. There's no waiting and spotting for days.

Unfortunately, hair does not grow inches overnight (or even in a few weeks for that matter). In a nutshell, this company takes all of the good, hair beneficial vitamins and puts them in delicious, easy-to-eat gummies. Can you go to the store and purchase the ingredients (Biotin, etc.) separately for cheaper? Definitely. But these are about having all of the healthy hair benefits in ONE bottle without the nasty taste that other vitamins/supplements have. I have struggled with consistent substantial shedding for awhile now so I wanted to give these a try. I hate swallowing pills- especially the ones that have a bad taste, so these seemed right for me. So far I have NOT noticed a big difference...maybe some baby hairs growing near my temples, but they ARE convenient, delicious and very easy to take. As for the acne topic...I did break out a tiny bit when I first started taking these but I honestly don't know if it was from the sudden influx of Biotin or an external source.

I worked up to a combined 5000 mg a day of C in combination with ester c and regular ascorbic acid powder. A peripheral benefit is an improvement in skin radiance, the whites of my eyes have become whiter, and the lifelong acne acne on my back has gone. I cycle this product with regular ascorbic acid and ester c. Both kids have begun taking one packet a day and report better energy levels and diminished acne."}]}, {"SortB": 1, "ASIN": "B00XHKASX4", "SortA": 1, "ProductName": "Nature's Truth Valerian Root 1200 mg Supplement, 90 Count", "Reviews": [{"rating": "4.0", "ASIN": "B00XHKASX4", "votes": 0, "author": "Sabrina Renee", "title": "It works BUT......", "id": "R3LFS5NGWD42B8", "text": "This product does work.
